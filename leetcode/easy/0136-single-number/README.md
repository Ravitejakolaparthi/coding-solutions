# Single Number

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a  **non-empty**  array of integers `nums`, every element appears  *twice*  except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [2,2,1]

 **Output:**  1

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

 **Output:**  4

 **Example 3:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [1]

 **Output:**  1

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
- -3  *104 <= nums[i] <= 3*  104
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = 0;
        /*
        XOR cancels same numbers like 
        uses associative and commitative property
        ex -> 4 1 2 1 2
        here
        n = 4
        n = 4^1 diff so nothin happen
        n = 4^1^2    ""
        n = 4^1^2^1 here according to associative cancel takes place
        n = 4^2  
        n = 4^2^2  same cancle takes place
        n = 4
        */
        for(int i =0;i<nums.size();i++)
        {
            n^=nums[i];
        }
        return n;
        

    }
};
```
