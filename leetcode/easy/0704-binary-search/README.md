# Binary Search

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- -104 < nums[i], target < 104
- All the integers in nums are unique.
- nums is sorted in ascending order.

```c
int search(int* nums, int numsSize, int target) {
 int low=0,high=numsSize-1;

    while(low<=high){
        int mid=low+(high-low)/2;

        if(target==nums[mid]){
            return mid;
        }
        else if(target>nums[mid]){
            low=mid+1;
        }
        else{
            high=mid-1;
        }
    }

    return -1;   
}
```
