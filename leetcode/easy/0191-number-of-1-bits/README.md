![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a positive integer `n`, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  n = 11

 **Output:**  3

 **Explanation:** 

The input binary string  **1011**  has a total of three set bits.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  n = 128

 **Output:**  1

 **Explanation:** 

The input binary string  **10000000**  has a total of one set bit.

 **Example 3:** 

 **Input:**  n = 2147483645

 **Output:**  30

 **Explanation:** 

The input binary string  **1111111111111111111111111111101**  has a total of thirty set bits.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= n <= 231 - 1

 

 **Follow up:**  If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

        while(n>0)
        {
            if(n&1 == 1)
            c++;
            n>>=1;
        }
        return c;
    }
};
```
